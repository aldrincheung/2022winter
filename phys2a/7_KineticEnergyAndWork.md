### Kenetic Energy
- Energy is a scalar quntity associated with the sttate of one or more objects
- Kinetic Energy -> state of motion of an object
  - $K=1/2mv^2$ 
  - (unit: $1\text{joule}= 1\text{J} = 1\text{kg}\cdot m^2/s^2$)

### Work
- Work is energy transferred to or from an object via a force acting on the object (can be +/-)
- Only the component of $\overrightarrow{F}$ along $\overrightarrow{d}$ can do work on the object
- $W=Fd\cos\phi=\overrightarrow{F}\cdot\overrightarrow{d}$
  - $\phi$ is the constant angle between $\overrightarrow{F}$ and $\overrightarrow{d}$
- $W=\delta K=K_f-Ki$ *work-kinetic energy theorem)
