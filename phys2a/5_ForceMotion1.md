### Equations
|type|equation|
|---|---|
|mass and acceleration|<br/>$\cfrac{m_X}{m_0}=\cfrac{a_0}{a_X}$<br/>&nbsp;|
|Newton's second law|<br/>$\overrightarrow{F}_{net}=m\overrightarrow{a}$<br/>&nbsp;|
|SI Unit conversion|<br/>$1\text{N}=(1\text{kg})(1\text{m/s}^2)=1kg\cdot\text{m/s}^2$<br/>&nbsp;|
|gravitational force/weight|<br/>$W=\overrightarrow{F}_g=m\overrightarrow{g}$<br/>with ground as inertial frame<br/>&nbsp;|
|Newtons third law|<br/>$\overrightarrow{F}_{BC} = \overrightarrow{F}_{CB}$<br/>&nbsp;|

### Newton's laws
- Does not apply to all situations 
  - `Ex.` very large speed interactions needs Einstein's special theory of relativity,
  - `Ex.` bodies are scale of atmonic structure, needs quantum mechanics
- **Newton's 3 laws**
  - **Newton's First Law**: If no force acts on a body, the body's velocity cannot change; that is, the body cannot accelerate
  - **Newton's Second Law**: The net force on a body is equal to the product of the body's mass and its acceleration
  - **Newton's Third Law**: When two bodies interact, the forces on the bodies from each other are always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction

### Terms
|term|def.|
|---|---|
|principle of superposition for forces|A single force that has the same magnitude and direction as the calculated net force would then have the same effect as all the individual forces|
|inertial reference frames|*aka. inertial frames*, is where Newton's laws hold, the ground is normally the inertial frame|
|noninertial frame|seeing objects that are not in relation to the normal view|
|normal force|the force that is perpendicular to the ground |
