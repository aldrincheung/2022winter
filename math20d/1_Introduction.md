# Introduction

#### Differential Equation Background
- models that yield an equation that contains some derivatives of an unknown function are differential equations
- `dependent variable` - the derivative of a variable in respect to another
- `independent variable` - the variable in respect to
- `ordinary differential equation` - diff. eq involving only ordinary derivatives with respect to a single independent variable
- `partial differential equation` - diff. eq involving partial derivatives with respect to more than one independent variable.
- `order` of a eq - the highest-order derivative that is present

#### Solutions and Initial Value Problems
- "An *n*th-order ordinary differential equation is an equality relating the independent variable to the *n*th derivative 
- `explicit solution` - given a function check if the function when solved for the derivatives and put in to a diff. eq, that if the diff. eq is valid
- `implicit soution` - The derivative of the solution would be identical to the diff. eq on an interval I

### Direction Fields
- direction field - A plot of short line segments drawn at various points in the xy-plane showing the slope of the solution curve
