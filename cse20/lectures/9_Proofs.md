### Types of proofs
|type|what it is|
|---|---|
|Proof of universal by exhaustion|To prove that $\forall xP(x)$ is true when $P$ has a finite domani, evaluate the predicate at each domain element to confirm that it is always T|
|Proof by universal generalization|To prove that $\forall xP(x)$ is true, we can take an arbitarary element $e$ from the domain of quantification and show that $P(e)$ is true, without maing any assumption about e other than that it comes from the domain<br/>An **arbitrary** element of a set or domain is a fixed but known element from that list<br/><br/>"Let $e$ be an arbitrary element of N"|
