# Proof Examples

A list of proof examples because it is hard to get what is needed in one

### Ex. 1
**Claim:** For any integers a, b (not both zero), *gcd*( (a,b) ) $\geq$ 1.<br/>
**Proof:** *Show that 1 is a common factor of any two integers, so since the gcd is the greatest common factor it is greater than or equal to any common factor.*

Toward a proof by universal generalization, let $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary integers (both not zero)<br/>
1 is a divisor of a because $a=1\cdot a$<br/>
1 is a divisor of b because $b=1\cdot b$<br/>
1 is a common divisor of a and b<br/>
by the definition of *gcd*, *gcd*(a,b) is greater than or equal to any common divisors of a and b<br/>
Therefore, *gcd*(a,b) $\geq$ 1
