# Lecture 16: Uncountably Infinity

### Cardinality categories
|category|def.|
|---|---|
|finite|the set is sempty or it is the same size as ${1,\cdots ,n}$ for some $n\in \mathbb{Z}^+$|
|countably infinite|the set is the same size as $\mathbb{N}$ (all countably infinite sets - same size)|
|countable|the set is either finite or countably infinite|
|uncountable|the set is not countable|

### Lemmas about countable and uncountable sets
|#|Lemma|
|1|If A is a subset of a countable set, then A is countable|
|2|If an uncountable set is a subset of A, then A is uncountable|
|3|If A and B are countable sets, then $A\cup B$ is countable and $A\cap B$ is countable|
|4|If A and B are countble sets, then $A\times B$ is countable|
|5|If A is a subset of B, to show that $|A|=|B|$ it's enuogh to give one-to-one function from A to B or an onto function from A to B|

### Uncountable Diagonal Proof


### General Facts
- For two sets A, B, we use the nation $|A|<|B|$ to denote $(|A|\leq |B|)\land\lnot (|A|=|B|)$
